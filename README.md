# LEDMAT3
HDMI - LED Display Controller (FPGA)
This is a simple FPGA project (and PCB as well) for driving the common LED panels based on MBI5124, MBI5153, and ICN2038 chips.
The input data is derived from TPG, or pre-compiled image, or HDMI input.
The USB-VCP port allows to control the basic LED display parameters.
